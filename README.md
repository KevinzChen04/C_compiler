# C_compiler

## Project Overview
The modern C compiler replicates what current compilers(Klang, GDB, Swift) use to speed up C code. This is done through a process of translating C code into simpler languages, built with a specific optimization in mind, going from C->LB->LA->IR->L3->L2->L1 before being translated to assembly and machine code. 

## Languages
### L1
L1 is a barebones language that serves as a middle ground between the back-end compiler and assembly. The language definition is very similar to assembly.
